### Summary of "Massively parallel genetic perturbation reveals the energetic architecture of an amyloid beta nucleation reaction"

- **Objective**: Systematically dissect the energetic landscape of amyloid β (Aβ42) nucleation, the key process in Alzheimer's disease aggregation.
- **Methods**: Combined high-throughput combinatorial mutagenesis (>140,000 Aβ42 variants), kinetic selection assays, and the MoCHI machine learning framework to measure relative nucleation rates and infer activation energy changes (ΔΔEa).
- **Key Findings**:
  - Quantified ΔΔEa for all single amino acid substitutions and >600 pairwise interactions, revealing the full energetic architecture of the nucleation reaction.
  - Identified hotspots where mutations greatly alter nucleation barriers and characterized energetic couplings correlating with residue proximity in fibril structures.
  - Demonstrated that interaction scores between residue pairs predict transition state contacts and align with multiple Aβ42 fibril cryo-EM structures.
- **Implications**: Provides the first comprehensive energetic map of amyloid nucleation, offering insights into transition state structure and potential therapeutic targets to modulate aggregation.
